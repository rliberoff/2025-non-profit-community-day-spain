# Copilot instructions

## Language Policy

All instructions and prompts in this repository must be written in English. This applies to:

-   All rule and instruction files in `.github/instructions/`
-   All prompt files in `.github/prompts/`
-   All custom agents files in `.github/agents/`
-   All documentation and code comments intended for contributors

Follow the instructions from the file `.github/instructions/follow-up-question.instructions.md` to ask for clarifications if you are not 95% sure about what to build or document.

Text and strings values intended for end users (e.g., UI labels, messages, documentation) may be in Spanish as per project requirements. But the code and development-related materials (like namespaces, classes, methods, variables, etc.) must ALWAYS be in English.  

If the solution has a `.editorconfig` file, you **MUST ALWAYS** follow the coding style and conventions defined in that file for all generated code.

## Spec-Driven Development

Follow the instructions from the file `.github/instructions/spec-driven-development.instructions.md` when designing and implementing new features by enforcing specification-first development at all times: before generating or modifying any code, tests, automation, or documentation, you must identify and follow a clear, complete, and testable specification for the requested change. This is **mandatory** when working with GitHub's Speck-Kit.

## Development Code Generation with C# and .NET

Follow the instructions from the files `.github/instructions/coding-style-csharp.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/object-calisthenics-csharp.instructions.md` when designing and coding solutions with C# and .NET.This is **mandatory** when working with C# and .NET.

## Azure and Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Follow the instructions from the file `.github/instructions/coding-style-terraform-azure.instructions.md` when designing and implementing scripts and templates that uses Terraform to deploy resources and services in Azure. This is **mandatory** when working with Terraform for Azure and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Commits and Pull Requests

Follow the instructions from the file `.github/instructions/conventional-commits.instructions.md` for all commit messages and pull request titles. This also applies to any automated commits or pull requests generated by GitHub Copilot, the Speck-Kit or other tools.
